# pebble-pomodoro

This app is available in 

https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/5772e69e6c21047b2c00040d

The reason I wrote this is that I couldn't find an app of pomodoro in pebble store that allows long breaks, memorize the time when existing or receiving a notification and shows the time, so I based an app (POMO D'ORO by Lucas Conceicao) I was using and wrote one

This pomodoro app in pebble can:

- Customize time (work, rest, long rest and long rest frequency)
- Ability to take a long break after several iterations
- Shows the time
- Easily to set the intervals in pebble app
- Count the time


Functionality: 
- Top button: Skip to the next iteration
- Middle button: Play and skip
- Bottom button: Clear everything 


Enjoy :)
